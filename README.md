# SleepingBarber
Dijkstraâ€™s Sleeping Barber Problem. A multithreaded java based program in which there is one barber, and multiple customers. The Barber completes the service before starting the next customer. The Barber starts but goes to sleep if there are no customers waiting. The first arriving customer wakes up the barber and receives service. After being serviced, a customer exits. The Barber goes back to sleep if there are no additional customers waiting to be serviced. If a customer arrives and the Barber is busy with another customer, the arriving customer must wait. No more than a fixed number of customers (say n) can be waiting. If n customers already are waiting, the next arriving customer exits.
